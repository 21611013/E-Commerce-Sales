# E-Commerce Sales Prediction Dashboard with R Shiny App

This repository contains the code for an interactive E-commerce Sales Prediction Dashboard built using R Shiny App. The dashboard allows users to explore a multiple linear regression model, view coefficients, assess model accuracy, and make sales predictions based on input parameters.

## Features:
- **Multiple Linear Regression Model:** Explore the coefficients and summary statistics of the regression model.
- **Model Accuracy:** View the R-squared value indicating the accuracy of the regression model.
- **Interpretation:** Understand the interpretation of each variable in the regression model.
- **Sales Prediction:** Input predictor values and predict monthly sales.

## Dataset:
The application uses a sample dataset (`data_A`) containing monthly e-commerce metrics, including website visitors, transactions, average items per transaction, customer satisfaction ratings, and online advertisements.

## How to Use:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R Shiny Dashboard script using RStudio or another R environment.
3. Interact with the dashboard in two tabs: 
   - **Model:** Explore the regression model, coefficients, accuracy, and interpretation.
   - **Prediction:** Input predictor values to predict monthly sales.

## Application Structure:
The dashboard has two main tabs:

### 1. Model
- **Model Coefficients:** Displays the coefficients of the multiple linear regression model.
- **Model Accuracy:** Shows the R-squared value indicating the accuracy of the regression model.
- **Interpretation:** Provides an interpretation of the impact of predictor variables on sales.
- **Regression Result:** Displays the original and predicted sales values.

### 2. Prediction
- **Input Predictor Values:** Allows users to input values for website visitors, transactions, items per transaction, satisfaction rating, and online advertisements.
- **Prediction Result:** Displays the predicted sales based on user input.

## Credits:
This dashboard is created as part of a Business Intelligence project during the 5th semester of an academic program. 

Feel free to explore, modify, and use the dashboard for your purposes. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please let us know!
